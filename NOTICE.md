# Regional COVID-19 Response Simulation (RCRS)
This simulation's master code repository is owned and maintained by [Luminesim Simulation and Analytics](www.luminesim.com/rcrs). You can contact us via our [website](www.luminesim.com) or by email at `info@luminesim.com.`

Luminesim Simulation and Analytics provides this simulation for free and on an as-is basis as per the license agreement. However, we ask users of the simulation to consider the following requests:

1. If you are publishing research based on the simulation and/or its derivatives, acknowledge *Luminesim Simulation and Analytics* in the Acknowledgments section (or equivalent) of your paper.
1. If you are a for-profit or not-for-profit entity using this model for paid purposes (e.g. through consulting income, product income, grant funds, donations, or otherwise), consider collaboration with our organization. This helps fund continued maintenance of the model and helps ensure that you understand all strengths and limitations of the model.
1. Ensure that all end-users of the model understand that the tool should never be used without the express approval and consent of regional health authorities.

**By using this simulation you understand and acknowledge that no simulation is a perfect representation of the real world. Local conditions, nuances, and phenomena not captured in the simulation mean the tool may deviate from real-world outcomes. This tool is therefore for your information only, should be run several times to see representative outcomes, and should be interpreted only after reading and understanding its documentation. Its results should only be used after planning for local conditions, consulting local authorities and stakeholders, and gaining the consent of local residents and organizations. Under no circumstances should you change local COVID-19 strategies without first consulting and gaining the consent of provincial and federal health authorities.**
