## ADDITIONAL CLAUSE: IMAGES, LOGOS, AND BACKDROPS
The LUMINESIM logo, LUMINESIM L-cloud logo, included LUMINESIM backdrops, and any LUMINESIM assets in the `LUMINESIM-Assets` folder remain property of Luminesim Simulation and Analytics. You are not permitted to use these images, logos, backdrops, nor assets in any public reproduction nor demonstration of the simulation nor in any derivative products without the express written permission of Luminesim Simulation and Analytics. You may, however, retain any simulation visuals (e.g. text boxes) stating the origin of the simulation and its code repository at your discretion. This additional clause takes precedence over any conflicting clause in the Apache 2.0 license.

## WARNING: IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING ANYLOGIC AND ITS LIMITATION OF THE CORE AGREEMENT
The AnyLogic Company places specific restrictions on compiled models (e.g. binaries or Object form in the Apache License) and their use in cloud platforms. Do not distribute any binaries, derivative works of the simulation in Object form, nor deploy such artifacts to cloud computing environments without first consulting the included AnyLogic license and the [AnyLogic Company](https://www.anylogic.com/). The AnyLogic license text takes precedence over this warning section, which is provided only to make you aware of notable conflicts with the Apache 2.0 license. The use of AnyLogic software does not constitute an endorsement from The AnyLogic Company.
